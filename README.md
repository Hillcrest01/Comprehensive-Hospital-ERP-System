Backend: Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF)
Frontend: React, Redux (optional), Axios
Database: PostgreSQL (or MySQL)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Deployment: Docker, Nginx (for reverse proxy), Gunicorn (for Django)
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Prerequisites
Before deploying the system, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine or server:

Python 3.8+: Install Python
Node.js: Install Node.js
PostgreSQL or MySQL: Install PostgreSQL or Install MySQL
Docker (Optional for containerized deployment): Install Docker
Git: Install Git
Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-erp-system.git
cd comprehensive-hospital-erp-system
Step 2: Backend Setup (Django)
1. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Configure the Database
Create a PostgreSQL or MySQL database for the project.
Update the database settings in the backend/hospital/settings.py file:
python
Copy
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',  # or 'django.db.backends.mysql'
        'NAME': 'hospital_erp',  # Your database name
        'USER': 'your_db_user',  # Your database username
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',  # Your database password
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',  # Default PostgreSQL port or your MySQL port
    }
}
3. Migrate the Database
Run the following command to apply migrations and set up the database schema:

bash
Copy
python manage.py migrate
4. Create a Superuser
Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:

bash
Copy
python manage.py createsuperuser
5. Start the Django Backend Server
Run the Django development server:

bash
Copy
python manage.py runserver
The backend will now be running at http://localhost:8000.

Step 3: Frontend Setup (React)
1. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
npm install
2. Configure API Endpoint
Make sure the frontend knows where to send API requests by updating the src/config.js (or similar file) to match the backend URL:

javascript
Copy
export const API_URL = "http://localhost:8000/api";  // or your backend URL
3. Start the React Frontend
Run the React development server:

bash
Copy
npm start
The frontend will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Step 4: Docker Deployment (Optional)
If you prefer to use Docker for deployment, you can follow these steps:

1. Create Docker Images
Navigate to the project root and use the provided docker-compose.yml file to build and run the system:

bash
Copy
docker-compose build
2. Run the Containers
Start the containers using:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up
The system will be accessible via the configured ports in the docker-compose.yml file.

Usage
Admin Panel:

URL: http://localhost:8000/admin
Login with the superuser credentials you created.
Manage users, patient records, appointments, inventory, etc.
User Authentication:

The frontend supports login for different user roles (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Patient).
Admin users can manage everything, while other users can access specific functionalities according to their role.
Patient Portal:

Patients can register, view appointments, and track their treatment and medical history.
Appointment Scheduling & Billing:

Doctors can schedule, view, and update appointments.
Admin users can handle patient billing and process payments.

Troubleshooting
Issue: Server is not starting.

Solution: Make sure all dependencies are installed (npm install for frontend, pip install -r requirements.txt for backend) and the database is properly set up.
Issue: Frontend cannot connect to the backend.

Solution: Ensure the API URL is correctly configured in the frontend (API_URL in config.js).
Issue: Database migration errors.

Solution: Check that the database credentials in settings.py are correct and the database is accessible.
